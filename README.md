One of the earliest memes on Japanese internet was 樹海　祝 where someone mistook 祝 (good luck) for 呪 (curse).

They wanted to write 呪ってやる ("curse you") on a tree in a suicide forest (Aokigahara Jukai), but they sucked at kanji so instead they wrote 祝ってやる ("celebrate you"). 

It turned out it was just a Photoshop, so they actually did write 呪ってやる, but it was a funny meme on Japanese internet back in 3rd grade.
